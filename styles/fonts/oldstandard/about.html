<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>This font is just the same as Alexey Kryukov’s beautiful <em>Old Standard</em>.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In comparison to the previous releases of <em>Old Standard</em>, it includes new letters and some corrections:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Small capitals for Roman, Greek and Cyrillic letters, in all three styles, Regular, Italic and Bold have been added. Small capitals, which were missing from <em>Old Standard</em>, were already in use a century ago in fine books which used font faces very similar to <em>Old Standard</em>. Typical use cases of small capitals were headers, current headings and in some books proper names.</li>
<li><em>For the time being</em>, a bold italic shape has been auto-generated. Of course, auto-generating shapes is not a satisfactory solution. However, it is better than using the font loader to emulate bold shapes. A real bold italic shape is planned in the versions of <em>Old Standard</em> to come.</li>
<li>The letter G with caron above, that is: Ǧ (<code>U+01E6</code>, uppercase) and ǧ (<code>U+01E7</code>, lowercase) has been added. It is the only character missing from <em>Old Standard</em> that is needed in some of the accepted standards of romanization of classical Arabic.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
<li>Additionally, this release corrects the <code>+ss06</code> feature provided by <em>Old Standard</em>. This feature is supposed to distinguish between regular and ‘curled’ beta (β/ϐ) and to print ‘curled’ beta (<code>U+03D0</code>) in medial position. This feature worked in most cases with the previous release of <em>Old Standard</em>. However, it failed if the beta is preceded by a vowel with an acute accent taken from the <em>Greek extended</em> Unicode block.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="why-a-new-release-of-old-standard">Why a new release of <em>Old Standard</em>?</h3>
<p>At the time of writing, <em>Old Standard</em> was last updated six years ago. Being unable himself to contact the author, the writer, while in need to have new letters included in <em>Old Standard</em> and some issues addressed, took the decision to make a new release of <em>Old Standard</em>, while maintaining the hope that the author will one day resume the development of this typeface.</p>
