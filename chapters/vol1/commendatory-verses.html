  <body><h1>Some Commendatory Verses</h1><h2>Urganda the Unknown</h2><h3>To the book of Don Quixote of la Mancha</h3><div class="poem"><pre class="verse" style="font-style: italic"><p>To the book of Don Quixote of la Mancha<br/>  If to be welcomed by the good,<br/>    O Book! thou make thy steady aim,<br/>No empty chatterer will dare<br/>    To question or dispute thy claim.<br/>But if perchance thou hast a mind<br/>    To win of idiots approbation,<br/>Lost labour will be thy reward,<br/>    Though they’ll pretend appreciation.</p><p>They say a goodly shade he finds<br/>    Who shelters ’neath a goodly tree;<br/>And such a one thy kindly star<br/>    In Bejar bath provided thee:<br/>A royal tree whose spreading boughs<br/>    A show of princely fruit display;<br/>A tree that bears a noble Duke,<br/>    The Alexander of his day.</p><p>Of a Manchegan gentleman<br/>    Thy purpose is to tell the story,<br/>Relating how he lost his wits<br/>    O’er idle tales of love and glory,<br/>Of “ladies, arms, and cavaliers:”<br/>    A new Orlando Furioso—<br/>Innamorato, rather—who<br/>    Won Dulcinea del Toboso.</p><p>Put no vain emblems on thy shield;<br/>    All figures—that is bragging play.<br/>A modest dedication make,<br/>    And give no scoffer room to say,<br/>“What! Álvaro de Luna here?<br/>    Or is it Hannibal again?<br/>Or does King Francis at Madrid<br/>    Once more of destiny complain?”</p><p>Since Heaven it hath not pleased on thee<br/>    Deep erudition to bestow,<br/>Or black Latino’s gift of tongues,<br/>    No Latin let thy pages show.<br/>Ape not philosophy or wit,<br/>    Lest one who cannot comprehend,<br/>Make a wry face at thee and ask,<br/>    “Why offer flowers to me, my friend?”</p><p>Be not a meddler; no affair<br/>    Of thine the life thy neighbours lead:<br/>Be prudent; oft the random jest<br/>    Recoils upon the jester’s head.<br/>Thy constant labour let it be<br/>    To earn thyself an honest name,<br/>For fooleries preserved in print<br/>    Are perpetuity of shame.</p><p>A further counsel bear in mind:<br/>    If that thy roof be made of glass,<br/>It shows small wit to pick up stones<br/>    To pelt the people as they pass.<br/>Win the attention of the wise,<br/>    And give the thinker food for thought;<br/>Whoso indites frivolities,<br/>    Will but by simpletons be sought.</p></pre></div>
